# Docker Qwen Code - Configuration Summary

This document summarizes all the configuration changes and additions made to the Docker Qwen Code repository to enable building and pushing Docker images.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Build Script (`build.sh`)
- A shell script to automate Docker image building
- Handles Docker group ID configuration automatically
- Supports optional pushing to container registry
- Provides command-line options for customizing build parameters

### 2. Added Makefile
- Provides convenient commands for common tasks:
  - `make build`: Build the Docker image
  - `make push`: Push the image to registry
  - `make run`: Run the container in detached mode
  - `make stop`: Stop and remove the running container
  - `make exec`: Execute qwen command in the running container
  - `make shell`: Access shell in the running container
  - `make test`: Run a quick test to verify the container works
  - `make clean`: Remove built images
  - `make login`: Login to GitHub Container Registry

### 3. Added Docker Ignore File (`.dockerignore`)
- Excludes unnecessary files from the Docker build context
- Improves build performance by reducing context size
- Follows best practices for Node.js/Docker projects

### 4. Added GitHub Actions Workflow
- Automated Docker image building and pushing
- Integrates with GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Runs on push to main branch and pull requests
- Includes security best practices with artifact attestation

### 5. Updated README
- Added documentation for new build automation tools
- Included instructions for using the build script and Makefile
- Documented the GitHub Actions workflow

### 6. Added Validation Script (`validate_setup.sh`)
- Validates the Docker setup configuration
- Checks for existence and correctness of files
- Provides a quick way to verify the setup

### 7. Added Documentation (`PUSHING_TO_GITHUB.md`)
- Detailed instructions for pushing changes to GitHub
- Explains GitHub App authentication method
- Alternative GitHub CLI approach

## How to Build and Push the Docker Image

### Using the build script:
```bash
./build.sh --tag latest --push
```

### Using the Makefile:
```bash
make build
make push
```

### Using Docker directly:
```bash
# Get Docker group ID
DOCKER_GID=$(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3)

# Build the image
docker build --build-arg DOCKER_GID=$DOCKER_GID -t ghcr.io/legido-ai-workspace/docker-qwen-code:latest .

# Push the image
docker push ghcr.io/legido-ai-workspace/docker-qwen-code:latest
```

## Security Considerations

- The Docker image runs as a non-root user (appuser) for enhanced security
- Multi-stage build ensures only runtime dependencies are included
- Uses minimal base image (node:bookworm-slim) to reduce attack surface
- GitHub Actions workflow includes security best practices

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Simplified Building**: One command builds the Docker image with proper configuration
2. **Automated Pushing**: Automatic pushing to GitHub Container Registry via GitHub Actions
3. **Better Security**: Non-root user and minimal attack surface
4. **Improved Performance**: Docker ignore file and multi-stage build
5. **Better Developer Experience**: Makefile provides easy-to-remember commands
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated workflows ensure consistent image building
